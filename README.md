## Hi,

It's Thanh Thao. I share in this page different work projects that I did during my master degree in Acturial Science as well as my journey of learning to code as well as data analyze.

I have passion to make data talk via beautiful and self-explaining graphs.

There are two main repositories:

-  Acturial Science
-  Data Analytic

I'm currently taking DAV exams as well as sharpenning my Data Analysis skills with courses on Datacamp. 

I'd add projects here a long the way.
